     * Retrieve a list of available Maestro workflows

     * schema required to trigger the workflow.
     * 
     * <p>The response provides key details that help users identify which workflows are available

     * metadata, such as when it was created, last modified, and by whom.
     * 
     * <p>This operation is useful for obtaining an overview of all workflows within the system, helping
     * users and systems know what workflows are defined, what inputs they require, and how they can
     * be triggered.
     * 
     * <p>### Use Cases:
     * - Listing all available workflows in a system for manual or automated workflow initiation.
     * - Reviewing the input requirements for a workflow before triggering it programmatically.
     * - Gathering basic metadata about workflows for auditing, logging, or reporting purposes.
     * 
     * <p>### Key Features:
     * - **Comprehensive Workflow Overview**: Provides a full list of workflows, giving visibility
     * into all the automated processes available within the Maestro platform.
     * - **Input Schema Information**: Each workflow includes its trigger input schema, showing
     * what data must be provided when triggering the workflow.
     * - **Metadata for Tracking**: Useful metadata like creation time, last modification date,
     * and user details are included to support tracking and auditing workflows.
